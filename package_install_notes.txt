Purposely didn't include any version numbers. This is a 'for_dummies' project anyway.
However certain projects do require version-dependent variants of key packages.

Also if you are just seeing this as a first-time user,
consider using a virtual environment
to avoid conflicts with existing packages on your system.

To create and activate a virtual environment, you can use the following commands:
Firstly navigate to your project directory in the terminal, then run:
>>> python -m venv --help #to be sure you have venv module available
>>> python -m venv your_venv_name  #create a virtual environment named whatever you like
>>> source your_venv_name/bin/activate  #on Unix or MacOS
>>> your_venv_name\Scripts\activate  #on Windows

After activating the virtual environment, you can install the packages listed in this file using:
>>> pip install -r requirements.txt

I personally like to create a folder where I navigate into,
and then set up the virtual environment there. Personal preference tbvh.

If you wish to deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:
>>> deactivate

If you wish to delete it, just delete the folder you created for it.
However if it's the venv you wish to delete then run:
>>> rm -rf your_venv_name  #on Unix or MacOS
>>> rmdir /s your_venv_name  #on Windows

Make sure to replace 'your_venv_name' with the actual name of
your virtual environment folder. This will help keep your project dependencies isolated.
and avoid conflicts with deleting virtual environments that might be in use elsewhere.
